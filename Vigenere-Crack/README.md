# Vigenere-Crack

This is the third and final part of my cipher tools application.  When this is finished,
it will be able to encode, decode, or crack a Caesar or Vigenere cipher.

# Methods

The ideas and methods for this Vigenere cipher cracker comes from [this paper](https://www.cipherchallenge.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Five-ways-to-crack-a-Vigenere-cipher.pdf) that I found while doing some research for this project.
I'm not sure if I'll directly use a method from that paper, or see if I can combine a few and come up with a different
approach to it.  I still have to investigae it further.
