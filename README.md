# Vigenere-in-C
 
This is a port of my earlier Vigenere project, originally written in Python.  
I've decided to port this over to C and add some command line functionality since I've never really made a CLI app before.
This is also a bit of an experiment since I'm not entirely comfortable working with strings and chars in C.  

The final version of this should have the ability to encrypt an entire .txt file based off of a passed key.
